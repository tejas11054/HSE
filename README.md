**Detection & Alerting an Unsafe HSE Situation**

Project Overview:

This project aims to enhance workplace safety by detecting whether workers are wearing the necessary safety equipment. It uses a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to identify safety gear worn by workers. If any equipment is missing, the system sends an alert through SMS and email, providing information about the missing elements and the associated photo. Additionally, an Android application is created to display these alerts in real-time.

Features:

1. Safety Equipment Detection:
Utilizes a YOLO model to detect safety equipment such as helmets, goggles, and other safety gear worn by workers.
   
3. Alert System:
Sends SMS alerts to an Android application if any required safety equipment is missing.

3. Real-Time Notifications:
Displays the missing equipment details and associated photos on the Android application.

4. Email Alerts:
Sends detailed alert emails with the missing equipment information and photos.

5. Android Application Integration:
Provides a user-friendly interface on an Android app to view alerts and images of missing equipment.
